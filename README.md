# get-together

Imagine moving to a new city for your dream tech job. You’re excited about the opportunity, but there's one problem: you love playing tennis, and none of your coworkers share the same interest. You want to stay active, meet new people, and enjoy your favorite hobby, but making new connections in a new city can feel difficult. This situation is common for many people, and it’s part of the reason we created GetTogether. The platform is designed to help users find and create events based on their personal interests. Whether you’re looking for a tennis partner, a group hike, or a local meetup, GetTogether helps you connect with people who share your passions.
GetTogether offers several features to make it easy for users to find and join events. You can create a personalized profile, manage your account, and even edit or delete events that you’ve hosted. The app also includes filters that allow you to search for events by location, date, and categories, which helps users find activities that match their interests more easily. This customization ensures that everyone can find something they enjoy, whether it’s a casual get-together or a more structured event.
To make sure users are accurately identified, GetTogether includes a student identification feature. This allows verified students to connect with others in similar academic or campus-related activities. It helps ensure that the platform remains safe and that users can connect with people who are genuinely looking for similar events and activities. Overall, GetTogether is designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for people looking to meet new friends, explore new activities, and join communities that align with their hobbies and interests. Whether you’re new to a city or just looking for something fun to do, GetTogether offers the perfect platform for connecting with others.
